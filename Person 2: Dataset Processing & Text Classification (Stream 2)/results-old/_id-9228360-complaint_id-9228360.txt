The tickets were booked for my minor son and myself. \nBooking Confirmation # : XXXX total amount was {$8600.00} The tickets were booked with XXXXXXXX XXXX however it was being held by XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX At the time of the booking, I was unable to select the seating. I went ahead and completed the purchase process and then was directed to the XXXX website in order to select my seats. \n\nI had to then set up an account on the XXXX website in order to select the seats. I did so and started to select my seats. At that time, I noticed on the return flight ( XXXX XXXX ) they were no business seats that were side-by-side and they were staggered. Since I am traveling with a minor, I needed the seats to be side-by-side. \n\nI went back to the American Express travel website, re-entered the same exact dates and the same passengers to and from the same destination, and I saw there was a different flight on the return, leaving the same day just a few hours later. I attempted to change the return but Amex website does not allow that. It requires you to rebook a new flight and cancel the previous flightEven though it was done minutes before. \n\nI rebooked that flight and then went ahead and selected the side by side seats that I needed. \nBooking Confirmation # : XXXX No other changes were made, just the return time that has a different plane seating configuration. \n\nI then went back to the original reservation and I canceled those tickets on the Amex website. \n\nA few days later, I was going to pay my bill online and noticed that the amount I paid for the first set of tickets were not refunded to me. I was still being billed for both reservations. \n\nI called American Express and they told me that the XXXX already expired and they could not assist me. I called the airlines multiple times and they told me my tickets were flagged as duplicate and they would give me a refund, however, because it was purchased through American Express. I had to deal with them. \nI called Amex again and was told XXXX did the ticket, so I must deal with XXXX. \n\nAfter multiple attempts with American Express representatives, I was informed to just file of dispute with American Express, which I did, and I was credited the amount of XXXX. The credit dispute for {$4300.00} was denied. \n\nI called again to ask about that and was told by Amex rep that the code the agent used for the {$4300.00} charge was not the same. He said, he needs to close out the {$4300.00} dispute and resubmit using the same codes that was used for the {$4300.00}. \n\nAs you can see, this was very frustrating for me. He said it would take a week to show up as a credit. \n\nI called again, week later and was told, no resubmit was ever made. The woman at Amex said she would resubmit and asked me to check back in 7 days. \n\nNow I get an email from Amex saying the credit for {$4300.00} has been reversed. \nI did use the tickets for XXXX I have spent countless hours on this and now, want a resolution ending with a full credit for both tickets. \n\nA duplicate ticket shouldve never been issued, and this is not my fault I did use the other tickets as planned Booking Confirmation # : XXXX",
