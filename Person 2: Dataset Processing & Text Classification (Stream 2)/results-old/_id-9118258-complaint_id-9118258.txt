On XX/XX/XXXX which was the first day that the financial company starting the process, I recognized they were simply applying for credit cards using my credit score and personal information -- I told them on the spot -- this is not what you advertised nor is this Business Capital -- it's creditr cards! They said they work with companies that can get capital off of the credit cards -- I said oh noooo, I need capital not credit cards. We go back and forth and the company wants to haggle over why credit cards is better or the same as capital -- I cancel this order over the phone and in writing.
