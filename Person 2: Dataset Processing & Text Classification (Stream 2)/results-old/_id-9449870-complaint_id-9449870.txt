This card used to have an option that if the balance was over a certain amount even if it was outside of Best Buy you could have interest free financing. Then within the year it turned to you receive an email and have to activate the email. I received an email each month and activate it each month which states Get up to XXXX month XXXX on each eligible purchase made with your My Best Buy Visa Card outside of Best Buy from the date you activate this offer until XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nActivate this offer by XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX for the following offer : XXXX  month XXXX on each eligible purchase of {$290.00} - {$590.00} or XXXX month XXXX on each eligible purchase of {$590.00} or more Only purchases made after activation will qualify for this offer. \nUse this special offer for travel, entertainment, home furnishings, car repairs and more! \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I charged XXXX to my card. On XX/XX/XXXX charged XXXX. Assuming this would be put i to my promotional balance. \n\nThis never happened. I called Citi bank the only number I have for the credit card the first time and the first person first told me Best Buy doesnt do interest free financing outside of Best Buy. Thats a lie. Finally they got to a point and said they do but I didnt activate my offer. So I gave them the date I received the email and about when I would have activated. Never thinking I needed proof because this hasnt happened before when I used it for this purpose. When I gave him the date he said I did not activate XXXX but I had in XXXX which was expired by this time. I asked for a manager went through whole thing again as well as in clouded the activation is through XXXX even if I didnt activate the one I did activate they confirmed I actiavated on in XXXX so that one would have still been valid. They advised they would file a complaint. I called back in a few days and had the same go around cut this time when I talked to the supervisor they said there had not been a complaint filed they would file XXXX and I would hear back on if they could move the balance but he has never seen this happen before. I then called can again to once again point out that I had activated an offer, they confirmed it and that something needs to be done because my balance is due. I would have chosen another card with perks if I knew they werent honoring their deals. He said a complaint had been submitted he could not change it and I would get a letter in XXXX business days. It is now over 30 days later I have not received anything and nothing has been done with my balance, but my next purchase on XX/XX/XXXX did make it to the promotional balances. This is misleading if they are not honoring there advertising. I lost out on benefits by using this card instead of a different one. I have attached XXXX of the many offers I get which was the most recent along with the one they say I activated and the one I say I also activated.",
