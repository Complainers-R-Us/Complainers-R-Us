I indicated I did not authorize the charges, and that they were fraudulent. I was instructed they would be changing my credit card, and assured they were taking care of the charges.

The invidual claimed it would take up to 60 days to get a resolution. I pointed out the dubious nature of the evidence provided and the rep. from citibank security refuesed.
