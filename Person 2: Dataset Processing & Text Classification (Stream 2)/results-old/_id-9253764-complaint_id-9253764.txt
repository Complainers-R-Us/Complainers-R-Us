I was told that I would receive a letter in the mail stating the reason. Unfortunately, I did not receive this letter. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I called and was transferred to XXXX XXXX ( ID XXXX ). He was polite, patient and made a sincere effort to understand my situation and find a means to address it. He first saw to it that I would gain access to a digital copy of the letter dated XX/XX/XXXX. He also submitted a message to your back office to reevaluate my account. He did mention that the decision was made based on credit bureau reporting, payment history and buy patterns. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I gained access to the digital copy of the letter dated XX/XX/XXXX. It stated the reason for the decision to close my account as XXXX and unusual purchase history on your credit account that Synchrony deems XXXX be indicative of future intention not to pay. \n\nAs a response to my XX/XX/XXXX call and the associated message submitted to the back office by XXXX XXXX, I received a physical letter [ Proc ID : XXXX ] dated XX/XX/XXXX from Synchrony Bank Customer Service Department. The letter confirmed that the closure was due to unusual payment or purchase activities on an account... \n\nMy Synchrony XXXX XXXX credit card account was opened back on XX/XX/XXXX. Over the course of this accounts history, I have on several occasions generated similar payment and purchase activities without any actions taken by or communication provided by Synchrony. These purchases were approved, my payments toward these purchases were processed and my credit limit was restored without issue. Furthermore, I have never made a late payment during the entire history of my Synchrony XXXX XXXX or for any other credit card, loan or payment plan over the entirety of my credit report history. All of my credit reports are free of late payments, unpaid debts or collections since inception. \n\nIf Synchrony Banks concern was of my potential intention not to pay, Synchrony could have elected to drastically reduce my credit limit to a modest sum to effectively address a perceived credit risk, all the while maintaining my account as active. \n\nAccording to the XX/XX/XXXX statement, XXXX Reward Points were earned during the last cycle on XXXX spend and XXXX Reward Points were pending from the previous cycle. \n\nGiven the abrupt and blunt action taken by Synchrony Bank, I can not help but consider that I have been taken advantage of. Just as I had accrued a total of XXXX XXXX Rewards Points ( equivalent to {$2400.00} in purchases on XXXX ) and were soon to be credited, my account was closed.",
