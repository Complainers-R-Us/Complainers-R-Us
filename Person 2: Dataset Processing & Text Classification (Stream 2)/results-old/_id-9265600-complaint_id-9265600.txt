I should have been charged {$11.00} upon exit for an extra day, not the entire {$96.00}. \n\nI attempted to contact the vendor to resolve this but did not get a response. Therefore I opened a dispute with Capital One on XX/XX/XXXX to reverse the prepaid parking charge since my entire stay was paid for by other means ( i.e. the XXXX XXXX ). \n\nCapital One did not reach out to the merchant to investigate but instead closed the inquiry saying it \" lacks the requested information ''.

They said they could re-open the dispute if I could obtain a better receipt. \n\nCapital One 's position is absurd and anti-consumer : XXXX ) Consumers can not control the amount of detail that a vendor provides on a receipt.
