I admitted my error and made payments to make up the bill. I continued to make payments but continued to receive calls so, in XXXX I sent enough money to pay the account off. \nI received a call in XXXX about a late payment, confused I went online and noted that the {$500.00} check that I had sent to completely pay off this account had not been accounted for on my statement. I went next to XXXX XXXX to verify that the check had cleared my credit union. Indeed, on XXXX XXXX Comenity cashed check number XXXX for {$500.00} which should have paid off my account in full. \nI called Comenity and spoke to XXXX who informed me that he did not see a {$500.00} payment on any of my Comenity accounts. He went so far as to insinuate that he did believe I made such a payment because he could not see the cancelled check I was holding. We spent an hour on the phone and the best he could do was start an inquiry which he even admitted could take months to resolve and suggested I just keep making payments until its resolved. \nNot happy with that answer I took my cancelled check to my local Kay XXXX so someone could see the cancelled check. The associate there contacted her Comenity contact who within 2 minutes located my {$500.00} check which they had credited to my Lane Bryant account, even though the check was made out to Kay with the Kay account number on it. \nThe Comenity associate I spoke to at Kay assured me they would correct the error, and all should be taken car of. Assuming all was good but still frustrated I went into the mall for some retail therapy. I headed for Lane Bryant because I was headed out of town and needed a few things. It was at Lane Bryant that I found out that Comenity had slashed my credit limit I assume because they said I wasnt making payments on my Kay account.\n\nAt home I checked my four other Comenity accounts and found the same thing. Comenity has slashed all four of my account limits that they hold because of essentially their error.\n\nI have asked them to fix this more than one time now. They reversed a {$50.00} payment from my Lane Bryant account and credited to to my Kay card. But, in doing so they charged me a {$37.00} late payment fee on my Lane Bryant Card even tough they sill had the {$500.00} payment as well as four other payments on either side of my due dates. \nThey have killed my credit report all over their error.",
