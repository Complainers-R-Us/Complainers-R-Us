  "complaint_what_happened": "CareCredit through Synchrony Bank was used to finance my hearing aid. My monthly bill was always due on the XXXX. I knew I had until XXXX of 2024, to pay off the balance of {$300.00} as that would be the one year of the interest free promotion. However, rather than the last day to pay the promotion being on the XXXX ( the billing date used for 11 months ), the payment was due earlier in the month on XX/XX/XXXX. Therefore, I missed the deadline to pay without the interest being added. It was a sizable amount over {$600.00} for added interest. I did not receive a separate email saying this payment would be due on XX/XX/XXXX. I only received an email regarding my normal due date of XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI feel this is a very misleading practice as it creates a different due date than the date used for the other 11 months. This practice does not happen with other promotions that I've used for interest free payments plans. In these cases ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ), the due date for the promotion payments stay the same as all previous due dates so the consumer is not blindsided at the end of the promotion. It seems like a deliberate trap by CareCredit to give consumers a different promotion pay off date that is earlier in the month than their typical payment due date. \n\nThe Promotion Terms did not include any dates for the end payment. I did finally find it on the statements on the second page when I looked at them in more depth on XX/XX/XXXX since I was confused about the larger payment due. I find the website to be a bit confusing and difficult to navigate. I did spend more time trying to find out why my payment was higher than expected and finally found the XX/XX/XXXX deadline in smaller print on the second pages of the statements. I don't believe customers should have to search so much for the different date and I feel it is a deliberate practice to create confusion and to trick customers into missing the final promotion due date. \n\nI received electronic notices of payment due dates for the XXXX of each month. However, no email was sent for the XX/XX/XXXX promotion deadline. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email with the monthly statement that included the interest charge. However, this went to spam since it was the only statement email I received during the promotion. I also received an email on XX/XX/XXXX saying my terms had changed. Again, this went to spam and was not seen until just now. This too seems like a deliberate trap to only notify customers after they missed the earlier due date for the last month 's payment of the promotion.",
