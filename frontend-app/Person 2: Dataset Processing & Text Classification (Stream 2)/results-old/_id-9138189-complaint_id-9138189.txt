I am in receipt of your letters dated XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX on which you deny my claims. I have already tried several attempts ( XXXX ) trying to solve these disputes in my favor. I have been trying to get these charges resolved in my favor since XX/XX/XXXX with Goldman Sachs Bank for almost a year. Even after all the facts and evidence that supports my claim in detail I keep getting denied erroneously. I have sent so much evidence and letters to support my claims but still continue to get denied one after the other. This is ridiculous. Is going to be almost a year and the denials keep coming and nothing gets resolved. My disputes are for an order on XXXX that arrived damaged a chair and then requested a label and the label was never sent and also XXXX wanted me to pay a shipping fee which is the seller on XXXX for my order. This XXXX charge was for {$110.00}. The other two charges were for a hotel that misled me on its website as an exclusive resort but when we arrived it was a dump and did not reflect the pictures on their website. Also the food was expired and we tried cancelling the reservations. The charges for the hotel were {$260.00} and also {$110.00} that I disputed. I want the Financial Protection Bureau to investigate credit card account management practices. Including how the bank resolved billing errors and how it refunds cardholders for disputes initiated. I have an Apple card with Goldman Sachs Bank as the official business handling the transactions. I believe Goldman Sachs consumer banking has had some issues with consumer banking since XXXX and continues to face some difficulties. The consumer banking does not know how to handle the complaints generated by customers and in return try to pretend they are solving the disputes but reps just end up denying the claims months later. These types of issues have been reported by the XXXX XXXX XXXX on many articles as early as XX/XX/XXXX. These are serious issues that need to be addressed and investigated. Apparently, the bank did not invest enough money in consumer business department operations since XXXX and this has hurt their business and how to handle customer disputes according to The XXXX XXXX XXXX. Since XXXX the Federal Reserve found problems with the bank 's consumer business. The Federal Reserve was concerned that Goldman Sachs did not have proper monitoring and control systems put in place to handle disputes and enough staff to work on claims. As a result, reps have been overwhelmed with disputes and claims from consumers and have no other choice but to deny the claims even if the claims are valid with substantial evidence like in my case. The joint business with Goldman Sachs and XXXX has been reported as a nightmare by the news outlets and Goldman Sachs wanting out of the deal by year XXXX. I thought that by having an Apple card was going to be a benefit for purchases but it has been a nightmare with many transactions been denied by the Goldman Sachs Bank from damaged merchandise, cancelled purchases and so on. These problems continue. I want Goldman to resolve my disputes in my favor and admit wrongdoing and to reevaluate their business practices and operations so the burden does not fall on the customers like myself. \nThank you in advance for your consideration.",
