Two on XX/XX/XXXX charged to my XXXX XXXX ( {$260.00} and {$220.00} ), and one charged around on XX/XX/XXXX to my Capital One XXXX ( {$230.00} ). XXXX reached out to me immediately noting the charges as fraud. It took me a day or two to realize there was also a charge on my Capital One debit XXXX. I reached out to both XXXX and Capital One, explained the situation, logged fraud investigations, and both accounts were closed and new credit cards issued. I also filed complaints with XXXX. Through much back and forth with XXXX, the charges of {$260.00} and {$220.00} on my XXXX XXXX were credited. The amount charged to my Capital One debit card was not. Last week I received an email from Capital One that XXXX provided all the necessary paperwork to prove the charges were valid. I called Capital One and explained that the charges were not valid. I was told that I had to provide more information from XXXX - like copies of my conversations with XXXX. I explained to Capital One that XXXX doesn't provide access to \" closed communications '' and my previous XXXX to XXXX support cases were closed. XXXX does not provide a phone number, only a chat/email option in their app. I opened a new case with XXXX. XXXX saying the can not resolve the issue without my first XXXX digits, last XXXX, and the expiration date of the card used. I called Capital One and asked for this information. I was told this is not information Capital One will provide. I asked what I should do since XXXX is saying that can't resolve this issue without that information and Capital One is saying they won't provide it. I was told that I need to get \" more info from XXXX. '' I asked what additional info I can provide and again I was asked to provide my previous chats with XXXX- which is something XXXX won't provide. I explained the predicament - both Capital One and XXXX are asking me to get information that neither organization will provide. I have opened another case with XXXX. XXXX is giving me automated messages and still asking for the first XXXX, last XXXX, and expiry of my debit card. I can't get any help from XXXX. I have sent this same information to Capital One via email and they have not responded. I am at an impasse with being able to resolve this.",
