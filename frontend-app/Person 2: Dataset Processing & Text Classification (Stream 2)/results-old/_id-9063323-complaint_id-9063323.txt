  "complaint_what_happened": "As a customer of a bank that routinely offers me 0 % financing on direct deposit ( cash ) and balance transfers for a fee of 3-4 % of the amount deposited or transferred, an offer I recently utilized ( 0 % til XX/XX/XXXX ; 3 % transfer fee ) showed interest accruing at 23.24 % annualized on my XXXX and XXXX statements. \n\nFor over FIFTEEN years I have utilized this bank 's products due to the favorable terms, and not only are the SAME OFFERS posted to my account monthly, they are sent via USPS -- paper based offers which I always retain if I utilize them and can provide this evidence. \n\nI have a XXXX FICO score and have never missed a payment. I always pay the amount in question OFF before the 0 % converts to a higher rate. As I have cards with far lower rates at this bank ( 9.9 % being the lowest ) why would I accept an offer that had such onerous terms? \n\nThe answer is : I did not -- there is only ever ONE offer presented to me at a time, so it's not like I \" clicked on the wrong thing '' and can provide YEARS of evidence to this pattern of utilization as well as the bank 's OWN documentation as to the offers continually issued to me electronically and by mail When I requested the bank correct the error -- again, their algorithms would never even POST an offer with terms like these, nor would I ever utilize such an offer -- they declined, saying I had \" accepted the offer ''. \n\nI know this is not the case. I also know how easy it is for records to be electronically manipulated ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and find it unfathomable how the bank would risk an open battle over such a small amount of $ $ ( to them ) For me, {$380.00} is a lot of money. \n\nMy first calls ( over 1 hour ) on XX/XX/XXXX I was promised a resolution and a letter of same in my account within 24-48 hours. I asked for any further interest accruals to be held pending the outcome of the investigation. \n\nI received NO letter as was promised and my bill closed with a SECOND month of interest accrual. \n\nMy calls today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) took over 1.5 hours and the bank stated that it was \" something I did ''. I was ( once again ) promised a letter with this determination -- I will add it to my file if it ever arrives. \n\nMy request is simple : honor the terms of the offer as it is always presented. The transfer fee has posted and is NOT in dispute. However, there should be NO interest accruing on this BT, with a pay off date of XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThank you",
