  "complaint_what_happened": "I originated a Plus Membership account with SamsClub membership in 2020. Somehow, Sams Club partnered with Synchrony since I became a member. \nI attempted to speak to the CEO of Sams Club regarding the way Synchrony is conducting their business but there is no way to speak to a CEO. So here is my concern : I pay my bill sometimes twice a month and many times more than the minimum payment. Yet despite my payments, I have been charged late fees.. On the XXXX statement, it shows a late fee of {$29.00} However it also indicates a payment of {$50.00}. \nThen again in XXXX, I was charged a {$40.00} late charge Yet posts show my payments XX/XX/XXXX, {$50.00} XX/XX/XXXX, {$50.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$40.00} late charge XX/XX/XXXX {$40.00} late charge All of the above is an accounting issue. NEXT! \nI received a message in my email that there was a message from Sams Club When I opened up my account a message popped up that I needed to call customer service. I called Customer Service and the 1st thing they say is in order to speak to me, they must verify who I am and they ask me for my name and the last 4 digits of my social security. I give them that information and then they infom me that they would send a link to my phone that I must do a video of myself. I told them that I did not wish to expose my image over the phone, or the internet and then they said I would receive a letter where they would require additional documentation like a copy of my drivers ' license, I told them that I would be willing XXXXo drive to Sams club and personally show them my drivers license but they said that club has nothing to do with the credit department. But it is sams club that initiated the credit. Had I known Synchrony bank or a third source would be handling my account, I would have not applied. \nI feel like they are infringing on my privacy by trying to force me to jeopardize my physical identity over the phone, internet or mail. They already authenticated me by asking me my name and last 4 digits of my social security number. It is my belief that sending this information is risky and because I refuse to do this, they refuse to discuss why I am being charged late fees. And Further they have stopped my purchase.",
